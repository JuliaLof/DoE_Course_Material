# Probability and Statistics in Python

## What do we need to know?  

The content in this chapter is considered as the knowledge you should have gathered in previous courses in statistical theory with the exception of how to use Python to solve problems in Jupyter notebooks. The material has been collected from various sources, such as: 

- [the onlinestatbook](https://onlinestatbook.com/2/index.html)
- [openIntro Statistics Textbook](https://www.openintro.org/book/stat/)

**NOTE**
This is a short repetition about statistics arising from understanding variation and its relation to some fundamental statistical tools.
