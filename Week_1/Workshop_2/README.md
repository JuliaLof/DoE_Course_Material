In this tutorial we will look at various ways of generating plots in Python. We will introduce three widely used libraries, namely matplotlib, seaborn and plotly. Matplotlib is the most basic of the three, but will give you the most options for customisation. Seaborn and Plotly will give you very nice plots very quickly, including interactive options. Hopefully you'll have a good idea of what you can do with these libraries after today's workshop!
